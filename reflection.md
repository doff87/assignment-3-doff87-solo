\- The most challenging portion of working with GitHub was maintaining consistency between the local and remote repositories. It is very easy, especially when you're trying to clone and remove branches, to erroneously affect the branch either locally or remotely in such a way that you cannot recover. I was careful not to do this, but at all times you're only a command away from destroying your progress.

\- Branching is extraordinarily helpful. It allows for people to work on the project simultaneously to different ends. It also permits code to be reviewed before being merged - it simply keeps the process of collaboration very 'clean'.

\- Well in a group project this seems essential for enabling everyone to work remotely at their leisure and then merge it all together. Beyond that though, it's vital for keeping alterations that may make the code temporarily unworkable separate from the main file. If each person had to endure another introducing code that was temporarily going to make the application unworkable that would be a nightmare to coordinate with for testing purposes.

\- In the future I'd probably be a bit more selective in a partner. There seemed to be a lot of confusion and differences in expectations. I have a lot on my plate as the sole provider for my wife and I while being a full time student. I barely have enough time and energy to push myself to work to time and standard.
