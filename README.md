# Assignment 3: Team Collaboration

Your team collaboration project starts here!

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Add your partner as a collaborator
3. Start working on your features

## TODO
- Update this README with project details
- Complete your assigned features
- Create pull requests
- Review partner's code

## Team Members
- David Offutt - doff87

## Project Description
- The purpose of this project is to provide some basic statistical analysis given a list of numerical values. The project is robust enough to provide input validation,
error-handling, function testing, and verbose documentation.


## Features Implemented

## David Offutt
- feature-testing: Tests the functions against an expected value.
- feature-error-handling: Ensures no non-numerical arguments are evaluated, which would crash the application.
- feature-validation: Ensures no None objects or empty lists are evaluated, which would crash the application.
- feature-documentation: Provides robust documentation.

## Highlights
- Number of pull requests: 6
- Number of commits: 27
- Merge conflicts resolved: 3

## Lessons Learned
- I learned a lot about GitHub actually during this project. Several times as I created clones from one branch to the other I had to learn how to completely remove a branch, either just locally or locally and remotely. More importantly I learned how to clone over a single branch and to keep cloned branches commit histories. Finally, I learned how to solve a merge conflict locally - prior to that in browser seemed the most intuitive way, but it has a lot of issues maintaining indents which are vital to good looking code and function in some languages.

## Reflection
- The most challenging portion of working with GitHub was maintaining consistency between the local and remote repositories. It is very easy, especially when you're trying to clone and remove branches, to erroneously affect the branch either locally or remotely in such a way that you cannot recover. I was careful not to do this, but at all times you're only a command away from destroying your progress.
- Branching is extraordinarily helpful. It allows for people to work on the project simultaneously to different ends. It also permits code to be reviewed before being merged - it simply keeps the process of collaboration very 'clean'.
- Well in a group project this seems essential for enabling everyone to work remotely at their leisure and then merge it all together. Beyond that though, it's vital for keeping alterations that may make the code temporarily unworkable separate from the main file. If each person had to endure another introducing code that was temporarily going to make the application unworkable that would be a nightmare to coordinate with for testing purposes.
- In the future I'd probably be a bit more selective in a partner. There seemed to be a lot of confusion and differences in expectations. I have a lot on my plate as the sole provider for my wife and I while being a full time student. I barely have enough time and energy to push myself to work to time and standard.
